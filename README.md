# Continuous Integration workshop

This repository holds the sample application (written in Python, using the Flask micro-framework) which can be used
to demonstrate the purpose of a Continuous Integration pipeline/toolchain.

A live version can be found here: https://barco-ci-workshop.herokuapp.com. This should normally stay up ad infinitum,
unless Heroku drops all the free stuff that is needed to run it :)

A PDF version of this workshop is also included in this repository.
